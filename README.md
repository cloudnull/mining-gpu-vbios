# Modified GPU vBIOS for mining

These `rom` files are the bios settings I use within my GPUs for Altcoin mining.

The vBIOS settings have been modified using the Polaris bois editor.

The `rom` files within this repo are organized by:

`$MEMORY_MANUFACTURE`/`$GPU_MANUFACTURE`/`$GPU_VARIANT`/`$CARD_TYPE`/`$MEMORY_QUANTITY`
